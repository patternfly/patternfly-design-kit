## 2020.04 release

This library release included many edits to existing symbols that will affect any current design files that you update with the changes. If you'd like to see specifics on those symbols, please see the [release notes](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-design-kit/blob/master/PatternFly%20release%20notes.md). One of the major updates we are making to the PatternFly system itself is decreasing the amount of white space thorughout components and pages themselves. You'll see these changes appear in the template file as well.

**Note** In this release and in upcoming releases, you will see a new label introduced in the symbol names called '[deprecated]'. PatternFly is releasing a breaking change release in May where components including labels and alerts will be completely redesigned from a visual standpoint. Because of this, we will be marking the "older" version of those symbols with '[deprecated]' so that designers begin transitioning any of the designs that include those older symbols to the new ones. You will see this symbol flow mostly introduced in the next release (April 21st). We will give ample time between April 21st and the breaking release (May 12th) for designers to make those updates. Then, once we reach that breaking release on May 12th, we will be completely removing those [deprecated] symbols OR updating the [deprecated] symbols to reflect the new designs. Depending on the redesign for those components, we may not be able to match the old ones 1:1 to the new ones (in that case, [deprecated] would be removed completely).
